This project aims to create a custom object detection model by leveraging on transfer learning from the pre-trained CenterNet Resnet50 V1 FPN 512x512 model. 
The custom model will be fine-tuned by training on a task-specific dataset, and aims to detect two classes: “person” (which is also an existing class from the COCO dataset) and “lightsaber”.
