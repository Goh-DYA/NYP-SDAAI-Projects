This project aims to create a custom object detection model by leveraging on transfer learning from the pre-trained CenterNet Resnet50 V1 FPN 512x512 model. 
The custom model will be fine-tuned by training on a task-specific dataset, and aims to detect two classes: “person” (which is also an existing class from the COCO dataset) and “lightsaber”. 
The custom object detection model is trained using the TensorFlow Object Detection (TFOD) API.

A report detailing the training and evaluation process may be found in the word document "Report - Training a Custom Object Detector.docx".
