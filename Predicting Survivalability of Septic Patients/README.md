This project aims to use machine learning to predict the survival of patients with sepsis. 
The Sepsis Survival Clinical Records dataset obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository will be used in this project. 

Classical machine learning algorithms (logistic regression, k-nearest neighbours, random forest, support vector machine) and a feedforward neural network will be used and their performance compared.
