With ongoing digital transformation efforts across various industries, many companies make use of electronic service tickets to keep track of requests. 
With a large volume of tickets, triaging and assignment to the appropriate team for resolution can be a resource- and time-intensive task. 
Delays in ticket resolution can impact the service-level agreement and customer satisfaction to great extent. 
Hence, the goal of this project is to automate the classification of e-service tickets to an appropriate category.
